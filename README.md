# PreWrap
[PreMiD Presences](https://github.com/PreMiD/Presences) wrapper for the [Discord-RPC-Extension](https://github.com/lolamtisch/Discord-RPC-Extension) with focus on security and performance.  
The included presences are not created nor maintained by me. All credit goes to the [PreMiD](https://premid.app/) team and their [contributors](https://premid.app/contributors).

### What is the difference to PreMiD
* No remote javascript execution or remote dependencies
* Permission requested only for the active Presences
* minimal content script and it only gets injected for the active Presence pages.
